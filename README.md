## 3. Evaluate and Play with PAwR over NUCLEO-WB09KE
This hands on allows to play with BLE 5.4 PAwR feature. In 05-STM32WB0-WS-PAwR.pdf file you will understand PAwR concepts and applications targetted.

**How to replicate:** the demo ([ESL like](https://github.com/stm32-hotspot/STM32WB0-BLE-PAwR-ESL)) is based on samples code part of [STM32CubeWB0](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubewb0.html#get-software) 

1. Build and flash STM32Cube_FW_WB0_V1.0.0\Projects\NUCLEO-WB09KE\Applications\BLE\BLE_PAwR_Broadcaster to NUCLEO-WB09KE
   - or flash the image part of PAwR binaries repository
3. Build and flash STM32Cube_FW_WB0_V1.0.0\Projects\NUCLEO-WB09KE\Applications\BLE\BLE_PAwR_Observer to NUCLEO-WB09KE
   - or flash the image part of PAwR binaries repository
5. Connect BLE_PAwR_Broadcaster NUCLEO-WB09KE to Docklight or Tera Term
   - Baudrate 115200 bps
   - Data bits: 8
   - Parity: none
   - Stop bits: 1.
6. Connect BLE_PAwR_Observer NUCLEO-WB09KE to Docklight or Tera Term
   - Baudrate 921600 bps
   - Data bits: 8
   - Parity: none
   - Stop bits: 1.
7. Once board associated (PAwR train exhanged) insert AT command on the BLE_PAwR_Broadcaster terminal to control LED of the BLE_PAwR_Observer.Type ATE to enable local echo.

- Turn on an LED on BLE_PAwR_Observer:
- - AT+LED=0,0,1
- Turn off the LED on BLE_PAwR_Observer with:
- - AT+LED=0,0,0

The demo is based on ESL profile implemenatation. 

I would strongly recommand to follow **https://github.com/stm32-hotspot/STM32WB0-BLE-PAwR-ESL** to get more details how to replicate and how to understand demo.

## 4. Add BLE to you existing application using Zephyr ecosystem thanks to X-NUCLEO-WB05KN1
First 06-STM32WB0-WS-Handson_BLE_AddOn.pdf will give you clear understanding about network processor topology and advantages. 
Thanks to X-NUCLEO-WB05KN1 expansion board you will then able to easily add BLE to an existing application.

**How to replicate:** The demo is based on Zephyr ecosytem and associated shield https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/shields/x_nucleo_wb05kn1/doc/index.html. 

Here we do recommand to follow up [Zephyr instructions](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html) for setup installation and build instruction.

## 5. Understand how to design your HW over WB0, how to test it and move to certification
In this part you will first understand how to secure your schematics and layout over STM32WB0, and how to tests it thanks to [STM32CubeMonRF](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemonrf.html)

**How to replicate:** The sample code required to test your HW is part of [STM32CubeWB0](https://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/stm32cubewb0.html#get-software) 
1. Build and flash STM32Cube_FW_WB0_V1.0.0\Projects\NUCLEO-WB09KE\Applications\BLE\BLE_TransparentMode to NUCLEO-WB09KE
2. Open STM32CubeMonRF
3. Set Baudrate to 115200 bps
4. From RF tests panel set a tone and access any RF tests
5. see results on spectrum analyzer
